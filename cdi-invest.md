## How the CDI works

- [Investidor CDI](https://invistacdi.vercel.app/)

The CDI (Interbank Deposit Certificate) is a very short-term security issued by banks. It is a very popular investment, and at the time of writing this article, its rates are very favorable.

Thinking about helping to answer questions about returns, I decided to create a [website](https://invistacdi.vercel.app/) to simulate the returns linked to the CDI.

One of the things that few people consider, but which is **crucial**, is the effect of inflation on returns over time.

You can simulate your initial contribution and monthly contributions, and see the return over time on the effect of inflation.

The values ​​are updated automatically according to the Brazil Central Bank.
