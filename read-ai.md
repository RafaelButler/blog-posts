## What is ReadAI

If you love reading, this project aims to further improve your reading experience. By providing a record and history of recent readings, it is possible to correlate the contents of the books you have read.

With AI, you can request recommendations for similar readings, correlate one reading with another and much more.

You can see how it was made in the repository:
